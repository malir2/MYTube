It is the first full stack project in which I am going to make website like youtube.

First I make a complete professional folder structure.

1. npm init 
2. public folder
3. src folder (index.js, constant.js, app.js)
4. push in git

                        "src Folder Structer"
Files:
    1. index.js
    2. constant.js
    3. app.js

Folders:
        1. Controllers:

        2. db:
            => database.js

        3. middlewares:

        4. models:

        5. routes:

        6. utils:


We use Prettier to format the documents


                            "Connect Database"

To connect database we will use following steps:

1.  Make database in "Mongodb Atlas".
2.  Copy Url of database.
3.  Paste this URL in .env.
4.  Set the name of database in constant.js.
5.  Than go back to the "database.js" and import "mongoose".
6.  Than import database name from constant.js.
7.  After that make a fuction to connect to the database and make it async function.
8.  Use "try/catch" method to make connection.
9.  Than export it as default.
10. Import it in "index.js".
11. Install and import "dotenv" in index.js so all environment variables start as soon as our app starts.
12. Due to import method we have to config dotenv and make changes in dev in package.json.
13. After that our database connects successfully.
